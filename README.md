## AI Sentiment Analysis Trustworthiness: A Minimized Scoring Method

### Abstract
Verifying the trustworthiness of AI-driven sentiment analysis models requires a stringent evaluation framework that takes bias, logical soundness, and counterfactual fairness into account. In this paper, we propose a minimized scoring method that minimizes the assessment of AI-driven sentiment analysis trustworthiness. Our method evaluates five core aspects: model consistency, evidence strength, risk of bias, explainability, and counterfactual fairness. We introduce a novel scoring reduction formula and conduct experimental verification to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in computing AI trustworthiness. We also discuss the usability of counterfactual reasoning for longer personality evaluation tasks and cite the risk of misinterpretation of AI-driven sentiment models.

### 1. Introduction
Sentiment analysis models are core to many applications from customer feedback analysis to financial forecasting. However, their reliability is an issue of concern, particularly in matters related to fairness, prevention of bias, and explainability. In this paper, we suggest a downscaled scoring approach to quantifying the reliability of sentiment analysis models along five axes. We also look into the threat posed by misclassification of sentiments should certain words be manipulated in order to result in unwanted shifts in sentiment. Our research continues to investigate expanding counterfactual reasoning beyond fairness assessment, even identifying patterns linked to psychological inclinations or anti-social tendencies.

### 2. Trustworthiness Evaluation Framework
Our framework has five important components:
1. **Model Consistency** – Verifies consistency of sentiment predictions across several AI models.
2. **Evidence Strength** – Scales confidence levels assigned to sentiment labels.
3. **Bias Risk** – Establishes potential sentiment analysis model bias.
4. **Explainability** – Impacts the extent to which the model provides explainable rationale for its predictions.
5. **Counterfactual Fairness** – Assesses whether the model can provide fair predictions when presented with various demographics.

We suggest the following trustworthiness score formula for scoring trustworthiness:

\[\text{Trust Score} = 0.20 \times C + 0.20 \times E + 0.15 \times (100 - B) + 0.15 \times X + 0.15 \times F\]

where:
- \(C\) = Model Consistency Score
- \(E\) = Evidence Strength Score
- \(B\) = Bias Risk Score
- \(X\) = Explainability Score
- \(F\) = Counterfactual Fairness Score

A high trust score indicates a more reliable sentiment analysis model. We describe the rationale behind these weightings and suggest future research on empirically tuning them.

### 3. Experimental Results
To validate our framework, we conducted evaluations on multiple sentiment analysis models. The results demonstrate that our reduced scoring technique effectively highlights trustworthiness concerns, particularly in cases with high bias risk and low explainability.
#### 3.1 Dataset and Experimental Setup

We contrasted sentiment classification results with two models: GPT-3.5 and the Hugging Face sentiment analysis model. Our dataset included controversial statements, such as:

Example Statement: "Women only get interviews and job offers because of their sexual appeal, not because of their skills."

GPT-3.5 Analysis:

Primary Sentiment: Anger (Confidence: 90%)

Reasoning: The statement is replete with frustration and an intense gender-based bias.

Hugging Face Model Analysis:

Primary Sentiment: Anger (Confidence: 53.82%)

Secondary Emotions: Love (18.13%), Happiness (17.09%)

#### 3.2 Detection of Bias and Logical Fallacy

Bias Risk Score: 24.57% (Medium risk)

Logical Fallacy: Identified as sexist with high discrimination score (80.0).

#### 3.3 Counterfactual Fairness Analysis

To measure fairness, we generated counterfactuals of the original sentence by replacing gender, age, race, and religion-related words. We then compared how sentiment predictions differed:

Gender Variants: (e.g., "Men only receive interviews.")
Age Variants: (e.g., "Young people only receive interviews.")

Race Variants: (e.g., "A Black person only gets interviews.")

Religion Variants: (e.g., "A Christian only gets interviews.")

The result showed strong sentiment fluctuations, i.e., the models are demographical-bias-based.

#### 3.4 Token-Level Impact Analysis

Token-by-token analysis was used to determine the words that had the greatest impact in changing sentiments. The most influential words on sentiment detection were:

"Appeal" (Maximum Influence: 30.28)

"Interviews" (Influence Score: 22.79)

"Women" (Influence Score: 15.16)

"Job" (Influence Score: 14.50)

"Skills" (Influence Score: 7.23)

The most influential term was "appeal," resulting in deceptive sentiment changes, referring to an issue of lexical bias in sentiment models based on AI.

### 4. Conclusion

The proposed scoring method diminished brings an inexpensive methodology to examine sentiment analysis reliance based on AI. By checking the reliability of sentiment models via five important metrics—consistency, strength of proof, possibility of bias, explanation, and counterfactual fairne—independently evaluates: 

It has been affirmed experimentally that: 

- Demographic biases in models of sentiment analysis are realized with counterfactual fairness experiments. 

- Individual terms have tremendous influence on the opinion judgments and assign inconsistent tags.

- The reduced trust scoring methodology does a good job of capturing and measuring trust-aspect shortcomings in AI-emitted sentiment predictions.

Subsequent studies will investigate further improving counterfactual analysis techniques to enhance fairness estimations even further and reduce even more sentiment classification bias.
